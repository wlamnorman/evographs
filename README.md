# Evographs
Starting of as a repository to explore algorithms on graphs with the intention of considering how populations evolve over time with a population structure determined by the graph.

## Implemented
* (spatial) Moran model on a `Graph` defined in `graph_structure.py`. See `moran_model.py`.

## :beetle: known-bugs :bug:
* 

## To be implemented
* Proper fitness function based on given payoff matrix and proportion of strategies.
* Possibility to visualise the evolution of the graph over generations.
