# Evographs
Starting of as a repository to explore algorithms on graphs with the intention of considering how populations evolve over time with a population structure determined by the graph.

## To be implemented
* Visualisation of graph over generations
* Tests
* `MoranModel` class
* Proper fitness function based on given payoff matrix and proportion of strategies.
* Visualisation
    - fitness over generations
    - proportion of strategies over generations.
