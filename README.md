# Evographs
Starting of as a repository to explore algorithms on graphs with the intention of considering how populations evolve over time with a population structure determined by the graph.

## Implemented
* (spatial) Moran model on a `Graph` defined in `graph.py`. See `moran_model.py`.

## :beetle: known-bugs :bug:
None at the moment.

## To be implemented
* `MoranModel` class
* Proper fitness function based on given payoff matrix and proportion of strategies.

* Visualisation
    - evolution of the graph over generations.
    - fitness over generations
    - proportion of strategies over generations.
