# Evographs
Starting of as a repository to explore algorithms on graphs with the intention of considering how populations evolve over time with a population structure determined by the graph.

## To be implemented:
* Spatial Moran model for populations with multiple strategies.
* Possibility to visualise the evolution of the graph over generations (and hopefully to save these as visualisations).
